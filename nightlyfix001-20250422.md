## üß∞ Overview 
_This space consists of identification and fix for the nightly failure issue during Easter 2025 caused due to unavailable libxml2._

## ‚ú® Issue

During the nighly and normal build of the images, a failure with below dependency error was observed:

```bash

## üöÄ Identification

 * Identify if the package libxml2 belongs to imported package from Debian, then it would be included in the file below:
   - https://github.com/gardenlinux/repo/blob/main/package-imports 
   
 * If not imported, we build the package from source by ourselves identified by :
   - https://github.com/gardenlinux/package-<PACKAGE_NAME>
   - Eg: https://github.com/gardenlinux/package-libxml2 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution
## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution

We identify the source package and modify the way the package is built from source in 2 step procedure below:

  - https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libxml2 reports libxml2 is not available for "trixie" (unstable/stable)
  ![Screenshot](libxml_unav_trixie.jpg)

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/gardenlinux/package-build
```

  - In this case,
     - we need to alter the prepare source and
     - update the procedure to build the package
     - using apt_src instead of Debian git src
  - Ref: https://github.com/gardenlinux/package-build/bin/source (apt_src Usage)

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/gardenlinux/package-libxml2
```
**Fix::** 
   - https://github.com/gardenlinux/package-libxml2/pull/3
   - https://github.com/gardenlinux/package-libxml2/commit/247c84c2966b99636d55e93cf8ddcf081ee3adf7
   - The above would ideally now fix the libxml2 package build during Image creation
